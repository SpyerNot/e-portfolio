After stepping into secondary school, my CCA was robotics to further pursue my passion in coding, in CCA we did scratch, microbit and tello drone. At upper secondary, my school offered O-Level Computing so I took this subject and started learning python coding. At the end of the year, I got top in computing. During my Sec 3 year, I signed up for multiple workshop. For example, BuildingBloCS March, June and December conference. I also took up a few competitions which include hackathon and CTF. </p>")
